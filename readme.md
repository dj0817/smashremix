# Smash Remix
*A Super Smash Bros. 64 Mod Organized by The_Smashfather*

## Building
### THIS IS ONLY FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN THE SOURCE CODE OF THE MOD. PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE RELEASE VERSION BY CLICKING THE RELEASE TAB.
The original xdelta will generate a smash rom that is compatible with our ASM code. Much of our edits are done within
the compressed files within the rom. If you utilize a vanilla Smash 64 rom, it will not work correctly.

You must utilize the xdelta patch to generate a good rom for Assembly.

You must place your legally acquired patched ROM in the rom folder for this to work. It must be named original.z64

# Features
(Note: Smash Remix requires the the 8 MB expansion pak to be enabled.)
